# ChonkySheep

Make sheep get chonky when they eat grass, they will have more wool than a normal sheep!



Whenever a sheep eats grass but already has wool the sheep grows more wool up to 2x the size they normally are! There are 20 different "chonky" levels.

The more chonky a sheep is the more wool it drops when sheared.
